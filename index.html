  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    When we donate or throw away clothing in the U.S. and Europe, much of it does not stay local.
    Large amounts are shipped to Accra, Ghana, where clothes that cannot be sold often end up in
    landfills, beaches, and burning sites. This creates environmental pollution and public health risks
    for the communities who live nearby.

          <h2>Look 1 | The Closet | What Happens When We Buy and Discard Cheap Clothing? </h2>
          <p>When was the last time you bought a cheap shirt and thought about what it was made of? Or where would it go when you no longer wanted it?</p> 
        

<p>Every garment we purchase, wear a few times, and donate to our local secondhand stores contributes to this global chain of production and disposal that is typically out of sight from the public eye. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that global textile waste amounts to 92 million tonnes annually (United Nations Environment Programme [UNEP], 2019). While many people may think donating to secondhand stores solves the problem, only a small fraction of these clothing items in the U.S. are resold in these stores, while most end up in landfills or incinerated. (Schumacher & Forster, 2022; Greenpeace Africa, 2024, pp. 4, 26).</p> 

<p>When certain clothing breaks down or is burned, it releases harmful chemicals like microplastics, greenhouse gases, PFAS, and other carcinogens that contaminate our food, water, and soil (Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, n.d.). These elements can create long-term consequences, transforming a simple shopping choice into a much larger public health concern that affects the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the foods we eat (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2025, p. 16).</p>

 

<p>For many consumers, an inexpensive shirt feels like a harmless purchase. However, something as simple as buying a shirt on sale can lead to harmful environmental and human health consequences, such as pollution to the air, water, and soil, and hazardous chemical exposure (Greenpeace International, 2018, pp. 3, 6; Greenpeace Africa, 2024, p. 15).</p>

 

<p>One common method of managing clothing waste in developed countries is exporting it internationally, with nations such as the U.S. and U.K. contributing to the global flow. Much of this ends up in cities like Accra, Ghana, a major hub for secondhand clothing imports, where residents face intensifying pollution exposure.</p>

 

<p>“Fast fashion is really at the root of an environmental and public health disaster that's unfolding in Ghana,” Sam Quashie-Idun, Head of Investigations at Greenpeace Africa and originally from Ghana says.</p> 

 

<p>Quashie-Idun describes the fast fashion industry as one centered around cheap clothing with low quality materials, short life spans, and fast output.</p>

 

<p>Although these garments may seem disposable, their long-lasting impact is far from it.</p> 

 

<p>Every purchase and donation is a part of a macroscale global system that links our closets to polluted air and waterways, endangered wildlife, and children’s health in nations like Ghana. And although these nations may seem distant, the microplastics that are found in their rivers and the smoke from incinerated clothing eventually make their way back to us, affecting ecosystems and communities near and far. </p>

    <h2>Look 2 | The Container | Where Donated Clothes Actually Go</h2>


          
          <p>So, where do unwanted clothes go once they leave our closets?</p>  

  

<p>In the Global North, which includes North America, Europe, and Australia, unwanted clothes are collected through charities, clothing banks, and in-store donations (Brooks, 2025; Braff & Nelson, 2022). While many may assume that these donations stay local, only about 20% of unwanted secondhand clothing in the U.S. end up on secondhand store racks, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Schumacher & Forster, 2022).</p>  

 

<p>A significant amount of secondhand clothing collected in Europe is exported internationally, every year. In 2019, nearly half of the exported worn clothing went to Africa, much of which that is not suitable for reuse eventually ends up in landfills or informal waste practices (EEA, 2023; Boschmeier, Ipsmiller, & Bartl, 2024).</p>  

 

<p>Globally, it is estimated that about 24 billion items of worn clothing are traded each year from high to low-income countries, such as nations in sub-Saharan Africa (Brooks, 2025). What many people think of as “donations” often funnel into a massive global trade.</p> 

 

<p>With Ghana being one of the final destinations.</p>  

 

 <p>“Ghana is really, suffering because of the overconsumption and the mass production of clothes from the Global North,” said Quashie-Idun.</p> 

  

<p>Much of these exported clothing articles end up in markets like Accra’s Kantamanto Market in Ghana, driven by local demand for inexpensive clothes from exporting regions such as Europe (The Or Foundation, 2023, p. 19; European Environment Agency, 2023). On the other hand, countries in the Global North choose to export clothing to nations like Ghana due to limited capacities and higher financial burdens (Boschmeier, Ipsmiller, & Bartl, 2024).</p>  

  

<p>To better understand how much secondhand clothing actually enters Ghana, I analyzed data from the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade), a database that tracks global export and import data. The analysis shows an overall increase in clothing imports, by weight, over the last three decades, with a small dip just before 2015 followed by a sharp rise. By the mid-2010s, Ghana was receiving about 100 million kilograms (about 220,462,000 lb) of secondhand clothing annually, roughly double what it imported in the early 2000s. In 2020 alone, the United States exported approximately 4,179,810 kilograms (about 9,214,892.72 lb) of used clothing to Ghana, highlighting the role of American consumers in this global system.</p>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/26696608"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26696608/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>

<p>After taking a closer look at the origins, the United Kingdom (UK), China, the Netherlands, Canada, and Germany were found to be the top five exporters of worn clothing into Ghana over this 35-year period. Even the smallest major exporter of the top-10 list plays a significant role: in 2015, India sent 2,116,560 kg (about 4,666,210.51 lb) of worn clothes to Ghana, representing millions of exported garments. Collectively, these countries have shipped millions of kilograms worth of secondhand clothing annually.</p>

<section class="look">
 <p>Further analysis revealed that the UK is not only Ghana’s largest supplier of worn clothing, but that Ghana ranks second globally in volume of UK’s total worn textile exports, trailing only Pakistan.</p>  

 
<img src="images/UKexports.JPG" alt="Clothing import impact in Accra" class="look-image">
<div class="look-text">

  <p>While the trade data shows the movement of goods, the human impact becomes clearer once the clothing arrives in Accra.</p> 

  

<p>These shipments flow into markets like Accra’s Kantamanto Market, supporting local jobs, and contributing to the city’s secondhand economy. But they also create a growing challenge: what happens when more clothing arrives than can ever be sold?</p> 

 

<p>This question becomes real inside Kantamanto Market itself.</p>

        <div class="look-text">
          <h2>Look 3 | The Market | The Heart of Accra’s Secondhand System </h2>
          <p>Kantamanto Market is one of the largest secondhand markets in the world (Greenpeace Africa, 2024, p. 23; The Or Foundation, 2022, p. 3). It is the largest in West Africa with approximately 30,000 working traders (The Or Foundation, 2022, p. 23) relying on the market for their livelihood (Johnson, 2023). Kantamanto is more than just a place of employment for the people of Accra. The market functions as a communal environment where people share meals, support one another, and cultivate social networks that provide personal and professional support for workers (Branson‑Skinner, 2023, p. 126).</p>  

  

<p>The Kantamanto market hums with daily activity, sustained by a variety of interconnected labor roles. Kayayei, or porters, transport bales into central Accra for the traders to purchase. Traders buy these bales without knowing what’s inside, turning each purchase into a financial gamble.</p>

<p>Once opened, traders will collaborate with tailors to repair or repurpose the clothing they received, ensuring alignment with customer interests and local fashion norms. Some garments are able to be restored and resold. Others are collected by waste managers to be sent to landfills, informal dumps, or sometimes exported to nearby nations, where the process begins anew (Dead White Man’s Clothes, n.d.; Greenpeace Africa, 2024, p. 23)</p>  

 

<p>A major part of the burden is clothing quality. Greenpeace, an international environment nonprofit organization, visualizes the risk component of the bale purchasing by noting that “Nearly half of these clothes are of poor quality, and many are made from synthetic fibres including polyester, nylon, acrylic and have no resale value” (Greenpeace Africa, 2024, p. 3).</p> 

 

<p>Quashie-Idun said he was shocked to see what western countries were sending to the sub-Saharan African nation when he witnessed a bale opening during a visit to the Kantamanto Market. Not only did he see clothes with rips and stains, but there were also many winter items in the bales, including hats, gloves, and jackets.</p>  

 

<p>“No one in Ghana is wearing that! Like it is too hot,” he said.</p> 

 

<p>Overall, this system creates both opportunity and risk for the traders, as their livelihood is dependent on the resale potential of the items in each bale. For many, the financial risk extends beyond the risks and finances, impacting both their mental and emotional wellbeing.</p> 

  

<p>“Ghana is already dealing with an economic crisis, everything is so expensive, the standard of living is high. People are not necessarily making enough money to afford basic necessities. So, when you add this added burden on top of it, then it will impact one’s mental health.”</p> 

   

<p>Traders have reported that the quality has declined over the last several years. In one Greenpeace study, stallholders estimated about 60% of the clothing they received in the bales was deemed as “unsellable.” Of those items, approximately 10-40% are then ultimately discarded as waste (Greenpeace Africa, 2024, p. 23).</p>  

  

<p>Many of the clothes in fast fashion today are made from plastic-based fabrics. A research study on Circular Economy and Sustainability reported that about 70% are made with synthetics that are cheap and within reach like polyester alongside acrylic and nylon. These synthetic materials do not fully break down, yet, instead they shed microplastics, or tiny plastic elements that are “invisible” to the naked eye (Earth.org, 2023; Chen et al., 2021).</p>  

 

<p>Because the tiny plastic particles do not biodegrade, they create risks for the planet’s soil, water, and eventually the food chain, contributing to contamination and pose significant environmental and human health concerns (Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, n.d.; Greenpeace Africa, 2024, p. 4, 26). While research on microplastics and human health is ongoing, emerging scientific studies, including a study highlighted by Stanford Medicine, has identified potential associations between microplastic exposure and cancer, cardiovascular problems, and reproductive problems (Stanford Medicine, 2025).</p>  

  

<p>What begins as a cheap shirt in one country becomes a serious environmental and human health burden in another.</p>  

 

<p>The accumulation of textile waste from clothing that could not be resold or repurposed now threatens the neighborhoods, waterways, and public health of Accra</p>

    <h2>Look 4 | The Overflow | When Clothing Becomes Waste</h2>
    <p>In Kantamanto, every bale tells a story, some of profit, others of loss. However, not all garments in the bales find a buyer, and what the market cannot maintain contributes to a textile waste crisis.</p>
  </div>
</section>


  

<p>After speaking with Samuel (Sam) Quashie-Idun, Head of Investigations at Greenpeace Africa, it became clear that the amount of textile waste is burdening the city of Accra. He describes the scale of the problem:</p>  

  

<p>“Despite having a thriving business that also repairs and repurposes second-hand clothes, about half a million items of clothing waste from Kantamanto market still end up in Ghana's open spaces.”</p>  

  

<p>Quashie-Idun went on to note that there are no facilities in Ghana built to manage this issue. Formal dumpsites can no longer handle the volume of textile waste, and many of the clothes are now ending up in informal dumpsites, covering the beaches, rivers, and other bodies of water with textile waste. This creates a growing concern for Ghana’s protected wetlands. The Greenpeace “Fast Fashion Slow Poison” report specifically highlights the Densu Delta Ramsar Wetland as an area designated to protect the city’s endangered wildlife and preserve local biodiversity. Greenpeace researchers have unfortunately found a growing amount of textile waste diffusing into this environment (Greenpeace Africa, 2024, p. 4).</p>  

  

<p>To help further visualize the environmental impact, Quashie-Idun described his firsthand experience while visiting Jamestown Beach:</p>  

  

<p>“I don't feel like I was even walking on sand because there were just so many clothes on, you know, on the beach.”</p>  

  

<p>As textile waste continues to grow at a faster rate than can be managed, textile burning is becoming a common practice. During the interview, Quashie-Idun explained that the incineration of clothing is being practiced helping control the amount of textile waste Accra is burdened with, in addition to being used as fuel (Greenpeace Africa, 2024, p. 3).</p>  

 

<p>Quashie-Idun raised an alarming question during our interview: “If clothes with plastic are being burned in this enclosed area, what are people breathing when they are showering there?”</p>  

  

<p>Sam Quashie-Idun noted that he and the Greenpeace team visited various parts of Accra to better understand the impact and burden of the textile waste. One area they visited was “Old Fadama,” considered a slum, or informal settlement in Accra. In areas like Old Fadama, communal areas for community members to bathe and “fulfill their hygiene needs” exist, Quashie-Idun notes. These communal bathing areas are locally known as bath houses. They saw that community residents were burning fast fashion items as fuel to heat up the water for hot baths. There was much concern from the Greenpeace investigators as they acknowledged the potential hazards of textile incineration, also considering these bath houses were in enclosed spaces. In the interview, Quashie-Idun confirmed the significant hazard that comes from the burning of the fast fashion synthetic materials, expressing the risk for potential exposure to harmful fumes. This observation of incineration led to further investigative research by Greenpeace on air pollution testing.</p>  

 

<p>“We found shocking results!” he said.</p>  

  

<p>Laboratory testing detected hazardous chemicals, such as benzene, styrene, various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and phenol, which can increase risk of cancer, reproduction issues, alongside potential genetic mutations (American Cancer Society, 2023; Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1995).</p>  

  

<p>Smoke from the incineration of synthetic textiles releases chemicals that may contribute to the city’s air pollution, posing a risk for the people of Accra and respiratory-related illness prevalence (Oppong‑Ansah, 2024).</p>  

  

<p>A fast fashion study completed by Yale University School of Medicine highlights the negative health impacts of incineration, advocating for a toxic-free fashion industry and safer alternatives. The study confirms that incineration releases toxic chemicals such as dioxins, formaldehydes, and heavy metals that pose risks for various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (Pinto & Peleg Mizrachi, 2025).</p>  

  

<p>While interviews and investigative reports show that burning unwanted clothing is a growing concern in Accra, I wanted to see whether it was affecting the health of Accra residents. I looked at coughing data, a key symptom of acute respiratory illness or infection (ARI), among children under five in Accra. ARI is a term used to describe upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including illnesses like pneumonia and bronchiolitis. ARI symptoms in children include coughing, fever, and other breathing difficulties (Klu, Alhassan, & Dansu, 2025).</p>  

 

<p>One of the greatest environmental risks to children’s health, according to the World Health Organization, is air pollution (World Health Organization, 2024). Research has shown that exposure to particulate matter in polluted air can increase the risk of ARI in children (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2025; Odo et al., 2022). These tiny matters irritate the lungs, triggering respiratory inflammation and making children more sensitive to other environmental irritants, which can negatively impact lung function (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2025).</p>  

 

<p>When looking at health and trade data, I found a surprising pattern beginning around the mid-2010s. Secondhand clothing imports around this time began to increase, coinciding with a resurgence in illness rates.</p>  

<div class="look-4-content">
  <img src="images/weightedari.JPG" alt="ARI prevalence" class="look-image">

  <div class="flourish-container">
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/26696608"></div>
    <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
  </div>
</div>


 

 

 

<p>The data spans several decades, with health surveys covering 1998-2022 and trade data dating back to 1989. Respiratory illnesses among children in Accra had been declining over the years. However, beginning around the mid-2010s, rates began increasing again. This increase occurs alongside the surge in worn clothing imports Ghana experienced, specifically from the UK and China. More clothes being imported means a greater need for textile waste management including burning unwanted clothing, a practice creating pollution, and negatively impacting respiratory health in Accra (Greenpeace Africa, 2024, p. 3).</p>  

  

<p>To make sure this trend was not impacted by other factors, like cooking-related household air pollution, I looked at what fuel families were using in their homes. Clean fuels include solar, electric, gas, alcohol, and certain biomass stoves (World Health Organization, n.d.), while unclean fuels include charcoal, wood, straw, animal waste, and other materials that can produce harmful smoke (The DHS Program, n.d.).</p>  

 

 <div class="image-wrapper">
  <img src="images/ARI1.jpg" alt="Clothing import impact in Accra" class="look-image">
  <p class="caption-text">Impact of clothing imports on ARI rates in Accra</p>
  <p class="caption-credit">Data: DHS Data</p>
</div>


 

 

 

<p>Even after accounting for potential household air pollutants, the respiratory illness rate still increased, alluding to the fact that the surge in illness could be a result of an environmental factor, such as textile incineration.</p>  

  

<p>Taken together, these patterns hint at the fact that the growing textile imports and poor textile management may be negatively affecting the health of Accra residents. While more research is needed to confirm the connection, the alignment of textile imports, incineration, and respiratory illness raises concern for a greater public health issue.</p>  

 

<p>The story of Accra’s textile waste visualizes a complex global system. A story where a single item of clothing can be innocently discarded in one country but end up in a landfill in another, creating environmental and public health challenges from the profuse waste. As the global chain creates economic opportunities for the city of Accra, it also drives harmful practices that affect the air children breathe, the wildlife in the protected wetlands, and the overall health and wellbeing of the nearby communities.</p>  

 

<p>Meaningful change requires action. It requires action from governments, industries, companies, and consumers. Every choice matters, from the brands we support and the clothes we buy to how we dispose of them. The result of our actions ripples across the globe, impacting the air we breathe, the water we drink, the foods we eat, and the health of children across the seas. </p>

        <p>Study Overview:
This story investigates the environmental and human health impacts of secondhand clothing imports into Ghana. The story focuses on how rising textile waste could be contributing to a resurgence of acute respiratory infection/illness (ARI) in children under five years of age in Accra, Ghana. Trade data from the United Nations Comtrade Database and health data from the Demographic & Health Survey database were analyzed to observe any correlation to better understand the impact of fast fashion and waste management. 

The rising ARI rates in Accra appear to coincide with worn clothing imports, suggesting that children’s health may be affected by the environmental exposures of textile waste management.
</p>
        <ul>
          <p>Research Question: How does fast fashion affect the public health of Accra, Ghana?
</p>

<p> Data Sources:</p>
<p>United Nations Comtrade Database (UN Comtrade) -
This dataset provided the trade data for the story
The UN Comtrade data utilizes export and import trade data related to worn clothing and Ghana. The years observed were 1989 to 2024.</p>
<p>Demographic & Health Survey (DHS) - Ghana 
This dataset provided the health data for the story.
The DHS analysis utilizes the “Children’s Recode” in the file format “SAS dataset (.sas7bdat)” for the years: 1998, 2003, 2008, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2022.
This dataset consists of answers from a large national survey based on data such as household information, women’s health, and men’s health. 
</p>

<p>Data Acquisition:
Approval was required to receive DHS data. Once approval was granted, DHS data was directly downloaded from the DHS Program website as a SAS format. UN Comtrade data was downloaded directly from the UN Comtrade database as excel sheets. All files were imported in RStudio for data cleaning and analysis.
</p>

<p>Study Population:
The study population for the DHS data was children under five years old who lived in Ghana, specifically Accra. 
</p>

<p> Analytical Approach: Descriptive analysis was used to identify the ARI prevalence using the coughing data. Additionally, this approach was also utilized for the trade data clothing import volumes. Comparative analysis was used to compare the ARI prevalence and the trade clothing import volumes. Data visualization was utilized to visualize all of the data that was analyzed. 
Line charts were used for trends over time.
Bar charts were used to compare categorical data.
</p>

<p>Tools & Coding:
Rstudio for data cleaning and analysis
Tidyverse, dplyr, haven, ggplot2, janitor 
Flourish for data visualization
Microsoft Excel
UN Comtrade data tool
Sublime text
Cyberduck
</p>

<p>Ethical Considerations:
Access to DHS datasets required agreeing to the DHS Program Conditions of Use. This included only using the data for the registered research project, keeping data secure and confidential, not redistributing micro-level data, and submitting a copy of the project to the DHS program. Only after accepting the conditions of use were the datasets downloaded. 
</p>

<p>Limitations:
There were various limitations for the data analysis conducted, including the following:
The DHS survey data is not collected every year, leaving only select years to be analyzed.
Not every available dataset had the “children’s recode” format nor the necessary survey questions needed for ARI analysis.
There is no guarantee that every DHS survey respondents are associated with the market, shop at the market, live near landfills or other polluted areas of Accra, etc. 
Trade data only observes export and import data but doesn’t account for the amount of clothing that becomes waste.
Textile incineration/environmental exposures cannot be directly measured in these datasets.
The associations that are observed are descriptive and do not infer definitive causation.
Other potential confounders in DHS data not available 
</p>

<p> Detailed Methodology:
I began this analysis by exploring health trends using data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS). I imported the data into R from SAS files. I initially analyzed diarrhea prevalence among children under five years old in Accra, examining trends by wealth and residence type (urban vs rural). I did not find any trends that aligned with the environmental concerns central to this story. Diarrhea prevalence had been decreasing over the years. From here, I shifted my focus observing acute respiratory infection/illness (ARI) prevalence amongst children in Accra under the age of five.</p>

<p>The data span several decades, with health surveys covering 1998-2022 and trade data dating back to 1989, while the UN Comtrade trade data on worn clothing spans 1989-2024. I analyzed the DHS data to calculate a weighted prevalence of ARI, measured using a caregiver reported cough in the past two weeks. The prevalence was weighted with a sample weight (V005) to ensure the results are representative of the entire Accra population and account for undersampled areas. The survey sampling weight is stored as a large integer, so I divided V005 by 1,000,000 to convert into a usable decimal (V005/1,000,000). Weighting represents true population prevalence rather than raw survey sample data.
</p>

<p>ARI prevalence had substantially declined into the 2010s. However, the prevalence began to gradually rise again around the year 2015. Interestingly, this increase occurs within the same time period in which the UN Comtrade data shows an increase in worn clothing exports, particularly from the UK and China. Given the growing concerns of textile waste management and incineration practices, this association between rising ARI prevalence and increased textile imports is worth investigating further. </p>

<p>To explore alternative explanations for the correlation, I controlled for potential covariates. One key covariate that was adjusted for was cooking fuel which can contribute to household air pollution. Cooking fuels were categorized as “clean” or “unclean” utilizing World Health Organization and DHS categorization. 
</p>

<p>The World Health Organization lists the following as “clean fuels (World Health Organization, 2018):” Solar, electric, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), alcohol (i.e. ethanol), biomass stoves classified as tier 4 or 5 for PM2.5 emissions and tier 5 for CO emissions.
</p>

<p>In addition, the DHS Guide lists the "unclean" or solid fuels as (The DHS Program, n.d.): Coal/lignite, charcoal, wood, straw/shrub/grass, agricultural crops, animal dung/waste, processed biomass (pellets) or woodchips, garbage/plastic, sawdust.</p>

<p>After adjusting for the cooking-fuel type, the ARI trend consistently showed a gradual increase. This helps to illustrate that cooking fuel type is not fully responsible for the upward ARI trend and more likely to be a reflection of environmental exposures such as textile incineration. In the adjusted analysis, the increase began in 2008, rather than 2015. However, even after adjusting for household cooking fuel, acute respiratory illness trends increased, which aligns with the trade export spike pattern, inferring that textile incineration is a plausible associated factor of this health outcome. While this does not establish causation, it strengthens the case that broader environmental factors could be contributing to the respiratory health trend increase and that further studies should be conducted.</p>

<p>After analyzing health data, I pivoted to the observing data from the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade), the world’s largest repository of international trade data (Duke University Libraries, 2023). I uploaded the CSV data into R studio and filtered for Ghana worn clothing imports (HS code 6309). From here, I grouped the data by year and calculated the sum of available records for both monetary value in U.S. dollars and the total weight in kilograms. The results were then visualized using line charts that displayed both the value and weight over the years from 1989-2024.</p>

<p>Because my story centers around the weight of the imports, I created a line graph that solely illustrates the weight of the imports and excluded value.
</p>

<p>To better understand the global context, I analyzed top exporters of secondhand clothing to Ghana, the importing partner. The data was filtered by the exporting country and the total weight of clothing per country during 1989-2024. Categories such as “World” were removed to avoid double counting. The highest-ranking countries were identified as the countries with the most amount of total export weight, visualized by a bar graph. The United Kingdom (UK), China, the Netherlands, Canada, and Germany were the top five exporters of worn clothing into Ghana over this 35-year period. 
</p>

<p>Furthermore, the data was then grouped by both year and exporting country to observe trends of volume of weight over time. These country-level trends were exported as a CSV file to Flourish to better visualize the data.
</p>

<p>I then wanted to see where Ghana ranks in the export destination ranking for nations like the UK and China. Further analysis revealed that the UK is not only Ghana’s largest supplier of worn clothing, but that Ghana ranks second globally in volume of UK’s total worn textile exports, trailing only Pakistan. 
</p>

<p>The UK trade data was grouped by destination and total export weight by adding up the available data, then ranked in order. Categories such as “World” were removed to avoid double counting. The top three destination countries were selected to be visualized in the bar chart. Ghana was given a distinct bar color. Annual trends of weight for the top three countries were visualized utilizing a line graph to show change over time.
</p>

<p>Finally, analysis of China’s exports were observed. I visualized annual trends in export weight for the top destination countries to examine how Ghana’s role has changed over time. Ghana is ranked sixth, which is still significant considering that Ghana has received millions of kilograms worth of secondhand clothing from China. 
</p>

<p>Similar to the visualizations for UK exports, I wanted to observe exportation trends for China over time. This line graph shows annual trends in export weight for the top destinations, including Ghana. These visualizations reinforce the scale of this issue.
